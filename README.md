# Rate My Therapist

The leading source for therapist reviews and ratings.


## User Journey

My name is Gerald and I want to leave a public rating/review on my recent therapist session. First, I will go to [Rate My Therapist](/). Then, I will search for my therapist, John Doe, by his name.
After finding him in the search results, I will click `Review` next to his name. After that, I'll see a review screen where I can give star ratings in multiple categories, as well as leave a paragraph review. After submitting, my star ratings will be rounded with the previous and showed on the therapist's page.
